Project Name: Handwave Audio Controller
<br>
The HandWave Audio Controller is a Python-based application that leverages computer vision to allow users to control the audio volume of their system using hand gestures. By using a webcam, the application detects specific hand gestures in real-time and translates them into commands to adjust the system's audio volume. This project utilizes Mediapipe for hand tracking and Pycaw (Python Core Audio Windows Library) to control the audio volume on Windows systems.

Use Cases
<br>
Accessibility:<br>
This application can be highly useful for individuals with mobility impairments who might find traditional input devices like keyboards or mice challenging to use.
<br>
Contactless Control:<br>
In environments where hygiene is a concern (e.g., in medical settings or public kiosks), this contactless method of controlling audio can be advantageous.
<br>
Entertainment Systems:<br>
The project can be integrated into home entertainment systems, allowing users to control the volume of their media playback without needing a remote or physical interaction.
<br>
Smart Home Integration:<br>
The gesture-based control could be expanded to manage other smart home devices, providing a seamless and intuitive user experience.
<br>
Public Spaces:<br>
In public spaces like museums, galleries, or exhibitions, where interactive displays might require audio control, this technology could be employed to allow users to adjust the volume in a contactless and intuitive manner.
